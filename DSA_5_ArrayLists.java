//        this is a static array which is size immutable and takes same space even if no element is stored.
//        on the other hand a dynamic array has a mutable size.

//        a dynamic array uses different static arrays to store a set of values.
//        when the previous array is filled completely then the compiler defines a new array with increased size.
//        for java the growth factor is 1.5 times. i.e. the new array initialized will be 1.5 times the previous one.

//        Advantages of ArrayLists:
//              we can do random access in O(1) time;
//              Good locality of reference and data cache utilization.
//              Easy to insert and delete at the end.
